This Streamlit app visualizes literacy data in the form of a Sankey diagram. The application allows users to upload a CSV file containing literacy data, view the Sankey diagram based on that data, and dynamically modify the data using a multiplier to see how changes affect the visualization.

## Features
- **Upload Literacy Data**: Upload a CSV file containing literacy data.
- **Sankey Diagram Visualization**: Visualizes the flow of literacy data between regions and countries using a Sankey diagram.
- **Dynamic Data Modification**: Adjust the values in the dataset using a slider to observe how changes impact the Sankey diagram.

## Requirements
To run this application, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `streamlit`: For building the web app interface.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `plotly`: For creating interactive Sankey diagrams.

You can install the required dependencies by running:
-`pip install streamlit pandas plotly`
